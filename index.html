            <p>Asian elephants have been considered an endangered species since 1986, as their population has decreased by at least 50% over the last 75 years or so. There are fewer than 50,000 remaining in the wild.</p>
            <p>Fragmentation, deforestation and an increasing human population are destroying the elephants' habitat and decreasing the space available for them to live in.</p>
            <p>The Sri Lankan, Indian and Sumatran Asian elephants can of course be found in their countries of name and other mainland Asian countries.</p>
            <p>However, the best opportunity to see Asian elephants is at The Gathering, a natural assembly of up to 300 elephants coming to the shores of the Minneriya Tank in Sri Lanka's Minneriya National Park during August to bathe and drink. It is the largest congregation of Asian elephants in the world.</p>

          <div class="text">
            <p>At the beginning of the 20th century, there were 100,000 tigers in the world. Today, this number is estimated to have dwindled to <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/tiger" target="_blank">round 3,900 in the wild</a>.</p>
            <p>Tigers need large areas of habitat, but living in some of the most densely populated places on Earth has placed them in locations that have caused significant conflict with humans. Habitat destruction and fragmentation has had the most significant effects on the tigers' habitats, and poaching is one of their biggest threats.</p>

          <div class="text">
            <p>Once the most widespread of Asian rhinos, Javan rhinos are now listed as critically endangered. With only one known population in the wild, it is one of the world's rarest large mammals.</p>
            <p>There are between <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/javan-rhino" target="_blank">58 and 68 in the wild</a>, with none living in captivity. The rhinos are often poached for their horns, although loss of habitat, especially resulting from the Vietnam War, has also contributed to their decline.</p>
            <p>The only population of Javan rhinos can be found in <a href="https://www.indonesia.travel/uk/en/destinations/java/ujung-kulon-national-park"  target="_blank">Ujung Kulon National Park</a> on the south-western tip of Java, Indonesia. The only other population, in Vietnam, was wiped out in 2010.</p>
